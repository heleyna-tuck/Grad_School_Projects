Here are a series of reviews I've recieved as a Graduate Student Instructor. I take pride in my ability to be well prepared, welcoming, and respectful when presenting and helping others. I think these reviews showcase my preformance. Note: Assignments like Case Studies (graded random student submission, not those of my lab students) were not graded or created by myself.
