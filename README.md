# Grad_School_Projects

This repository contains all of my current graduate school projects from 2023-2025 at The University of Michigan Applied Statistics program. Projects range from collaborative coding, a variety of models, and various datasets. Most of these projects include a supplementary report. Within the 504 class, most emphasis was put on choosing code and models provided to create a concise memo to address a self-identitfied research question.
