This project was done using the NHANES dataset, creating our own research questions. This was a group project with two other graduate students. We all collaborated on the coding and writing when neccessary. Two main research questions were analyzed: 
1. How well can we predict caffeine consumption (in mg) will be above the daily recommended limit (400 mg) within demographic, nutritional, and sleep information.
2. How well can we predict sleep hours, and with that predicted sleep do they get the recommended amount (more than 7 hours) a night with demographic, nutritional, and sleep information.

Data merging along with various models such as KNN, Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, and Random Forest were used to answer these two questions. Provided is the Proposal and Report created with a team of three graduate students.
