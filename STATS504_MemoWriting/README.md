This folder contains seven memos from an array of datasets and models provided in class. Responsibilities included being able to pick models to use and interpret with a research questions I chose. Personally, I really enjoyed this course, given some direction but mostly open-ended on how we wished to write about certian findings. 

Assignment 1: Determine whether survival disparities between males and females exist across centuries and how they evolve. Using Marginal Survial and Hazard Functions. 

Assignment 2: Using the Generalized Extreme Value distribution to model extreme rainfall trends In both Miami and Detroit. Specifically, characterizing the upper tail of rainfall distributions. 

Assignment 3: Analyzing a wide range of phenotypes in mice across different ages, using nonparametric one-way ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis) procedure, followed by BH correction to control for False Discovery Rate to id phenotypes that show evidence of change. Principal Component Analysis was used to characterize these changes. 

Assignment 4: Exploring temperature and salinity variability in the Pacific Ocean at various depths using Principal Compoenent Analysis. 

Assignment 5: Model natality using a Gamma regression model with Generalized Estimating Equaitons (GEE). Specifically, explores the relationships between socio-economic facotrs, urbanicity, and temporal trends. 

Assignment 6: Temporal Trends in Fern Distributions Across Latitudes. To investigate latitudinal shifts, linear models predicting latitude as a function of time(day) and other variables using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression for each species. 

Assignment 7: Temporal Dynamics of Solar X-ray Flux. Investigation on how the autocorrelation structure of GOES X-ray flux varies over time using gobust, nonparametric methods. Specifically, if dominant modes of temporal dependence differ between 2017 and 2019, using block-wise Kendall tau autocorrelation and Principal Componenet Analysis to id and summarize patterns in the data.
